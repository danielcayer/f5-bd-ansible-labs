# Modify based on deployment
#F5_VIP_Name: F5VPN 
SSL_Cert: localCA/webcert.crt
SSL_Key: localCA/webcert.key
SSL_CA: localCA/localCA.crt
#F5_SSL_Client_Profile: Demo_Client_SSL_profile

# If the F5_SSL_Client_Profile is undefined, the playbook will prompt user to enter the virtual server name and the corresponding Client SSL profile name.
# This variable can be set at runtime if full automation is desired (with the "-e" parameter, or in the f5_vars.yml file).
# For example:
#     ansible-playbook Replace-Certificates-in-existing-ssl-client-profile.yaml -i hosts -e @f5_vars.yml -e "F5_SSL_Client_Profile=Demo_Client_SSL_profile"
